<p>Imagine the joy at Music Routes HQ when I saw that <strong>Vanilla Ice</strong> is credited with bass on <strong>Dweezil Zappa</strong>'s cover of "Stayin' Alive" with an all-star cast of guitarists including <strong>Steve Lukather</strong>!</p>
<p>Alas, it is just a "little joke from Dweezil" in the words of <a href="http://www.stevelukather.net/Session.aspx?id=145" target="_blank">Lukather's web site</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Dweezil says "<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-29/entertainment/ca-1192_1_frank-zappa?pg=1" target="_blank">It's a sad day when Vanilla Ice gets more attention than good musicians who actually play instruments and music, doing things that are much more creative.</a>"</p>
<p>And in another interview, <a href="http://idiotbastard.com/Interviews/DweezilZappa.htm" target="_blank">Dweezil opines that Vanilla Ice "deserves" derision</a>.</p>
<p>Oh well. On the upside, <strong>Donny Osmond</strong> is apparently really singing the lead vocals!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-29/news/mn-1142_1_donny-osmond" target="_blank">Donny Osmond did the lead vocal only after <strong>Ozzy Osbourne</strong>'s label balked at allowing Dweezil to release the lead vocals that Osbourne had recorded for the track.</a> The version with Ozzy Osbourne on it was eventually released on Ozzy's <em>Prince of Darkness</em> compilation.</p>
