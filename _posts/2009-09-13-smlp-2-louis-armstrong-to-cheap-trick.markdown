  content: ha, genius on how that one ended up.  But what about Tau Moe's Hawaiian
    Jazzites. ; )

<p>My lady-friend is more than just a little bit into Polynesian pop culture and the street name in our new address is awfully close to that of a Pacific Island.  So our friend Michele K-Tel made a mix of Hawaiian music for our housewarming, which happened to be on Saturday.  We'll be using "On A Coconut Island" sung by <strong>Louis Armstrong</strong> as our jumping off point.</p>
<p>My $1 LP purchase for the listening party this weekend: <strong>Cheap Trick</strong> <em>At Budokan</em>.</p>
<p>So, let's look at the route from "On A Coconut Island" To <em>At Budokan</em> in six steps.</p>
<p>"On A Coconut Island" pairs Louis Armstrong with <strong>Lionel Hampton</strong> and a quartet of musicians (<strong>Sam Koki</strong>, <strong>George Archer</strong>, <strong>Harry Baty</strong>, and <strong>Joe Nawahi</strong>) billed as <strong>The Polynesians</strong>.  In <em>Louis Armstrong: An American Genius</em>, James Lincoln Collier describes the Hawaiian guitar on this track as producing a "whine" that is "extremely irritating".  That description is utter nonsense.</p>
<p>As with last week's listening party route, this one involves a duet with <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong>.  Louis Armstrong and Frank Sinatra performed "Birth Of The Blues" together on television.  This performance was later released on the Sinatra collection <em>Classic Duets</em>.</p>
<p>Late in life, Sinatra released a collection of duets called <em>Duets</em>.  He and <strong>Bono</strong> sang "I've Got You Under My Skin".</p>

<p>Bono and <strong>U2</strong> recorded "When Love Comes To Town"  with <strong>B.B. King</strong> for U2's <em>Rattle and Hum</em>.  B.B. King in turn recorded an album of collaborations for his 80th birthday that featured <strong>Billy Gibbons</strong> of <strong>ZZ Top</strong> on "Tired Of Your Jive".  </p>
<p>Gibbons is on, of all things, "Dead End Streets" by <strong>Revolting Cocks</strong>, the side project of <strong>Al Jourgensen</strong> of <strong>Ministry</strong>.  The song features<strong> Jello Biafra</strong> of <strong>The Dead Kennedys</strong> on vocals.  Gibbons takes the first slide guitar solo.</p>
<p>The second slide guitar solo is taken by <strong>Rick Nielsen</strong> of Cheap Trick which, of course, brings us to <em>At Budokan</em>.</p>
