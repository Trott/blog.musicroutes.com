<p>Metromix has <a href="http://losangeles.metromix.com/music/photogallery/heavy-metal-smackdown-metallica/685265/content" target="_blank">an amusing <strong>Metallica</strong> vs. <strong>AC/DC</strong> feature</a> that made me wonder how far they are from each other in Music Routes.</p>
<p>Metallica are surprisingly close to <strong>Paul Anka</strong>.</p>
<p>AC/DC are surprisingly close to <strong>Randy Newman</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm sure the stuff in the Metromix feature about Metallica making a "custom" of having "10 naked girls waiting in their dressing room showers" is an exaggeration of Brobdingnagian proportions.  But I guess when you're going for the funny, it helps to be opportunistically credulous.</p>
