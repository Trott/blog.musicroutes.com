<p>A user submitted some minimal discography information for <strong>Monk Siddiq</strong> and mentioned in their note that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brian Wagoner was the bass player in the <strong>Boyd Tinsley Band</strong> and sang on "Slow Change" by <strong>Jimmie's Chicken Shack</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, they didn't provide an email address so I couldn't follow up to ask for more information.  Here's what I need from anyone that can provide it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is Brian Wagoner on any recordings released by the Boyd Tinsley Band?  Did the Boyd Tinsley Band release <em>anything</em>?</li>
<li>Who else is on "Slow Change" by Jimmie's Chicken Shack?  And is Brian Wagoner on the version on the <em>Slow Change</em> EP or is it some other version we're talking about?</li>
</ol>
