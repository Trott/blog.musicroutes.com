<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-194" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/2879862757_f12c8de423_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="149" />I guess my sister tipped off her Swedish in-laws and friends to <a href="http://musicroutes.com/" target="_blank">Music Routes</a>.  Swedish punk bands have showed up in the log of routes that people search for but which are not yet in the database. Naturally, I feel the need to correct these database deficiencies.</p>
<p>So, for whoever was looking for a route between Millencolin and Refused, <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Millencolin&amp;musicianName2=Refused" target="_blank">here's your route</a>.</p>
<p>I still have to collect data for No Fun At All.  <a href="http://musicroutes.com/add.php" target="_blank">Help?</a></p>
<p>(Naturally, I'd also be interested in any data that would connect any of <a href="http://pics.yemii.com/swedish-dance-bands.html" target="_blank">these musicians</a> to other people.)</p>
