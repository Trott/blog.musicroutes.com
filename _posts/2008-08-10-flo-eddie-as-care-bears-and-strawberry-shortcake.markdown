  content: Flo &amp; Eddie didn't perform, produce, and write *for* Care Bears and
    Strawberry Shortcake records. They performed, produced, and wrote Care Bears &amp;
    Strawberry Shortcake records. The music was all them.

<p>I found out recently that <strong>Mark Volman</strong> and <strong>Howard Kaylan</strong> (<strong>Flo &amp; Eddie</strong>) performed (as well as produced and wrote) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_Bears" target="_blank"><strong>Care Bears</strong></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Shortcake" target="_blank"><strong>Strawberry Shortcake</strong></a> records in the 1980s!  Anyone know which tracks on which records they played on, and who else was on those tracks?  It would be fantastic to be able to route between Strawberry Shortcake and [insert favorite offensive shock-rocker here]!</p>
<p>Speaking of Volman and Kaylan, does anyone have (or know where I can obtain) details about the sessions for <strong>T. Rex</strong>'s <em>Electric Warrior</em>?  I have the CD credits, of course, but they don't say which tracks have <strong>Burt Collins</strong> playing flugelhorn and which do not have flugelhorn on them at all.  Additionally, it would appear that there are some missing personnel, at least in the liner notes I have.  There is definitely keyboard on "Bang A Gong (Get It On)" but it is not credited in the liner notes that I have.  <a href="http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1975" target="_blank">Blender says it's <strong>Rick Wakeman</strong></a> and I have no reason to doubt them, but it makes me wonder what else is missing from the liner notes.  There's a photo in the CD booklet that makes it look like perhaps <strong>Tony Visconti</strong> is singing background vocals.</p>
