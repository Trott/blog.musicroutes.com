<p>The supergroup concept is back.  (Or did it never leave and I just didn't notice?)</p>
<p>Alternative and indie fans with an ironic streak can check out <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tintedwindows" target="_blank"><strong>Tinted Windows</strong></a> with members and ex-members of <strong>Smashing Pumpkins</strong> and <strong>Fountains of Wayne</strong>.  And <strong>Cheap Trick</strong>. And <strong>Hanson</strong>.</p>
<p>Alternative and indie haters with no ironic awareness whatsoever can check out <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thechickenfoot" target="_blank"><strong>Chickenfoot</strong></a> with members and ex-members of <strong>Van Halen</strong>, <strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers</strong>, and the <strong>Coldplay</strong>-suing <strong>Joe Satriani</strong>.</p>
<p>Hagar has been quoted as saying that Chickenfoot's greatness could rival that of <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong>.  <a href="http://idolator.com/393956/van-hagar-spin+off-could-be-the-new-led-zeppelin" target="_blank">Really</a>.  (One would think that with grand aspirations, one would select a name that wasn't <em>Chickenfoot</em>.)</p>
