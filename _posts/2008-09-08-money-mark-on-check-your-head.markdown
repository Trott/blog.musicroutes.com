<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-58 alignleft" title="Check Your Head" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/bbcyh.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="300" />On which tracks on the <strong>Beastie Boys</strong>' <em>Check Your Head</em> does<strong> "Money" Mark Ramos-Nishita</strong> play keyboards?</p>
<p>This goes back to the whole <em>when is someone a performer and when is someone a producer</em> issue and the whole <em>this track-by-track data sometimes does not exist</em> issue.  I want to exclude him as a performer on tracks where he is doing production work only.  And, of course, I want to exclude him as a performer on tracks where he is not involved at all.</p>
