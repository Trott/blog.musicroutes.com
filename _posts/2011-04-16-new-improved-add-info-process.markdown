  content: I just entered Weather Report's Birdland. I didn't notice any difference
    except the additional comments box is gone. This kept me from telling you that
    I was the one who entered the info, and thereby  increasing my musicroutes street
    cred. I'll have an interior dialogue brainstorming session and see if I can think
    of anything that would improve the adding of info, but I think it works pretty
    good as it is. I just had an idea when I wrote that sentence. What about providing
    links on the add info page to the websites that you use to get your info (i.e.
    discogs) and maybe a quick how-to paragraph about what info you find to be the
    most useful. Everytime I go to add something I have to go to my bookmarks to open
    discogs and wikipedia etc. to cross reference anyway so having these at hand might
    be useful to others as well.

  content: I took another look at it and discovered the drop down menus when you click
    the band names. So are these bands that you want more info on or is it random?

<p>I'm making substantial changes to the process for adding information to Music Routes.  Rather than try to get it all right and roll it out in one big blob, I'm pushing out pieces as they're done.  </p>
<p>Go give it a whirl and let me know what you think!  Chances are you'll come up with all the things that bother me, but you'll have a better solution in mind.</p>
