  content: "Steve Martin has a new banjo album out. It has a lot of guest stars, which
    should help you rack up more connections. This is from the product description
    on Amazon:\r\nThe Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo is the first full-length
    bluegrass album from actor/comedian/musician Steve Martin. After playing on the
    Grammy Award winning Foggy Mountain Breakdown with Earl Scruggs, Martin began
    writing a string of new banjo songs, some with lyrics and some as instrumentals.
    An album forty-five years in the making, The Crow features special appearances
    by Dolly Parton, Vince Gill, Mary Black, Tim O'Brien, Earl Scruggs, Pete Wernick
    and Tony Trischka. Recorded in Dublin, Hollywood, Nashville and New Jersey and
    produced by John McEuen, of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the album consists of
    fifteen original tracks written by Martin."

  content: "Thanks, Will!  As it turns out, I was sent the liner notes to The Crow
    and I added all the data a short time ago.  \r\n\r\nThe liner notes are pretty
    funny.  E.g., about the song \"Tin Roof\": \"Tin Roof, of course, is slang for
    methamphetamine.  Just kidding.\"\r\n\r\nThanks to Dolly Parton's presence on
    The Crow, two of the sample routes above are now shorter.  Steve Martin to Bruce
    Springsteen went from 4 steps in the sample route above to 2 steps if you do the
    search now.  Steve Martin to Blue Öyster Cult went from 5 steps to 4 steps.\r\n\r\nIt
    is interesting that John McEuen of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band produced and played
    on The Crow.  Martin's 1970s novelty hit \"King Tut\" featured Jeff Hanna of the
    Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\r\n\r\nAnd now, just for you, Will!  Steve Martin to the
    Replacements via Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson, Paul Simon, and The Beach Boys:  http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=8c4a63860722e7f3bb67c1cb50b52c01"

Some of the connections worked and some didn't.  I added some data so that they all work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Steve+Martin&amp;musicianName2=Bruce+Springsteen" target="_blank"> Steve Martin to <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Steve+Martin&amp;musicianName2=Eva+Cassidy" target="_blank">Steve Martin to <strong>Eva Cassidy</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Steve+Martin&amp;musicianName2=Phish" target="_blank">Steve Martin to <strong>Phish</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Steve+Martin&amp;musicianName2=Blue+Öyster+Cult" target="_blank">Steve Martin to <strong>Blue Öyster Cult</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each route starts with  "King Tut" which was recorded with <strong>Jeff Hanna</strong> of the <strong>Nitty Gritty Dirt Band</strong>.  I like to mix things up a bit more than that, so I want to add a few more Steve Martin tracks, but I'm having trouble locating precise personnel information for tracks he has recorded.</p>
<p>I am especially excited about the idea of getting the personnel information for Steve Martin's cover of "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" from the soundtrack of the late 1970s movie flop <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> which starred the <strong>Bee Gees</strong> and <strong>Peter Frampton</strong>.  It is probable that the drummer on that track is <strong>Bernard Purdie</strong> whom <a href="http://blog.musicroutes.com/?p=246" target="_blank">I've written about before</a>.  (Seriously, go watch the video in that last link if you haven't.  It is my absolute favorite non-<em>Sesame Street</em> YouTube clip.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't be certain from the album credits alone that it is Purdie playing the drums on that track.  (The track, by the way, is terrible, but we don't discriminate on the grounds of quality here at Music Routes HQ, much to my girlfriend's chagrin.)   You can look at a scan of the relevant part of the album artwork in <a href="http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=762024" target="_blank">the fourth album artwork image from the top on a page at the awesome Discogs site</a>.  In nice big letters near the top right, you can see that it credits Bernard Purdie with drums and percussion.  But keep looking further down in the smaller print below "Special Thanks To:" and you'll see that <strong>David Dowell</strong> and <strong>Jeff Porcaro</strong> played some drums on the record as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>How can I determine which drummer played on this cover of "Maxwell's Silver Hammer"?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Jeff Porcaro was the drummer in Toto and a much sought-after studio drummer before his untimely death.  But...</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><br />
Who the heck is David Dowell?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I can't find anything about that guy.</p>
