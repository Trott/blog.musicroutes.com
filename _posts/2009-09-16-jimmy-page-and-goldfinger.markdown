  content: Page first confirmed his presence on "Goldfinger" in a 2007 interview for
    Classic Rock magazine.  He even described how Shirley Bassey fainted at the end
    of her performance.

  content: "Jimmy Page together with Big Jim Sullivan and Vic Flick would have been
    on nearly all of the UK records in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nRick Wakeman doesn't remember
    BJS at the recording of Space Oddity but I expect there were many sessions."

  content: "While it's not impossible that Big Jim Sullivan played on \"Space Oddity\",
    it is very unlikely.   \r\n\r\nExactly one person (Herbie Flowers) remembers Big
    Jim Sullivan being on the \"Space Oddity\" session while everyone else involved
    in the session (and, for that matter, Big Jim Sullivan himself) has no recollection
    of Sullivan being involved.  No studio records corroborate his involvement on
    the session either.\r\n\r\nThe most likely explanation: Herbie Flowers is simply
    mistaken.\r\n"

<p>In the film <em>It Might Get Loud</em>, <strong>Jimmy Page</strong> tells <strong>The Edge</strong> that he recorded "Goldfinger" with <strong>Shirley Bassey</strong>.</p>
<p>This is certainly plausible and would be awesome to include in the Music Routes database.</p>
<p>But I like to get confirmation for things like this.  After all, studio musicians with long careers often get some pretty crazy ideas.  <strong>Bernard Purdie</strong> thinks he played on a <strong>Beatles</strong> record and that <strong>Ringo</strong> did not.  <strong>Big Jim Sullivan</strong> says that <strong>Herbie Flowers</strong> remembers him at the recording sessions for "Space Oddity".</p>
<p>My Google Fu is failing me on this one.  Everything that reports that Page played on "Goldfinger" pretty clearly got it from the movie.  It's a long, long, long shot, I know, but anyone have any independent confirming information on this?</p>
