<p>Rumor has it that <a href="http://www.gigwise.com/news/47207/Aerosmiths-Steven-Tyler-To-Join-Led-Zeppelin" target="_blank"><strong>Steven Tyler</strong> of <strong>Aerosmith</strong> recently jammed with members of <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong></a>, perhaps auditioning to take the place of <strong>Robert Plant</strong> for some possible upcoming shows.</p>
<p>With the data currently entered into <a target="_blank" href="http://musicroutes.com/">Music Routes</a>, Steven Tyler is six steps from Robert Plant.  Oddly, the route goes through <strong>Cher</strong>.</p>
<p>I suspect the route could be shortened if reliable track-by-track personnel data were available for <em>The Honeydrippers: Volume One</em>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The good news is I did it!  Now it's only five steps and the Cher track is not in the path.  The bad news is that "The Dogs Of War" (winner, according to Wikipedia, of a <strong>Pink Floyd</strong> fanzine's poll on which of Pink Floyd's songs is their worst) is in the route.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The route is now down to two steps.  But the link is the <a href="http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=VJN3u1wAWIk" target="_blank">Canadian contribution to <em>We Are The World</em></a> (called "Tears Are Not Enough" and credited to <strong>Northern Lights</strong>).  This just keeps getting weirder.</p>
