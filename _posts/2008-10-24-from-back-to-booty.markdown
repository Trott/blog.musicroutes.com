<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-144" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/butt.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><em>JamsBio Magazine</em> has <a href="http://magazine.jamsbio.com/2008/10/23/songs-about-butts/" target="_blank">an annotated song list entitled "Songs About Butts: No Ifs or Ands About It"</a>.  (Side note:  Is that really <strong>Mississippi John Hurt</strong> in that first clip or is that a cover?)</p>
<p>There is an editor's note indicating that "Baby Got Back" and "(Shake Shake Shake) Shake Your Booty" were intentionally left off the list.  Naturally, that made me wonder how long the route is between <strong>Sir Mix-A-Lot</strong> and <strong>KC &amp; the Sunshine Band</strong>.  <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Sir+Mix-A-Lot&amp;musicianName2=KC+%26+the+Sunshine+Band&amp;x=16&amp;y=8" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Sir+Mix-A-Lot&amp;musicianName2=KC+%26+the+Sunshine+Band&amp;x=16&amp;y=8" target="_blank">The answer is eight steps.</a></p>
<p>However, I'm certain this path can be made shorter.  If you know how, <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">let me know</a>!  Bonus points for a shorter path that happens to go through one of the other songs on the <em>JamBio</em> list!</p>
