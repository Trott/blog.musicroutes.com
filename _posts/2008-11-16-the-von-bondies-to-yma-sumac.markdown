<p>A few days ago, someone searched for a route between <strong>The Von Bondies</strong> and <strong>Yma Sumac</strong>.  At the time, there wasn't enough data in the database to connect them, but now they are connected.</p>
<p>However, the route is a whopping 14 steps (at the time of this writing, anyway).</p>
<p>Certainly, this can be made shorter.  But how?</p>
