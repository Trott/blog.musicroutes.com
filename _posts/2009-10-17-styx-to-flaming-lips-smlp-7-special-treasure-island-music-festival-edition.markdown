<p>Today's $1 purchase from the second-hand shop and the start of this week's route: <strong>Styx</strong>, <em>Pieces Of Eight</em>.</p>
<p>Mostly, I bought it because there are moai on the cover and a song entitled "Aku-Aku", thematically connecting it to <strong>Martin Denny</strong> and <strong>Arthur Lyman</strong> from last week's listening party.  But the title of the album itself is sort of pirate-themed and I'm going to the <a href="http://treasureislandfestival.com/ " target="_blank">Treasure Island Music Festival</a> this weekend to see <strong>The Flaming Lips</strong>.  Of course, the name Treasure Island is sort of pirate-themed too.</p>
<p>So the other end of this week's route will be the <em>Embryonic</em>, the new Flaming Lips record.</p>
<p>The route starts with "Renegade" from <em>Pieces Of Eight</em>.  During the listening party, Humuhumu noted that the verse of "Eye Of The Tiger" by Survivor bears a striking resemblance to the verse of the other big hit from the record, "Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)".  I bring this up only because this route starts with "Renegade",  but I don't have much to say about it.<br style="clear: both"/><br />

<p>"Renegade" was written and sung by <strong>Tommy Shaw</strong>.  When <strong>Warren Zevon</strong> was terminally ill and recording his last album, Tommy Shaw joined him to sing background vocals and play 12-string guitar on "Knockin' On Heaven's Door".</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jKHFWpaTUmY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jKHFWpaTUmY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Much earlier in Zevon's career, he wrote "Tenderness On The Block" with <strong>Jackson Browne</strong>.   Jackson Browne produced and sang background vocals on the track which appears on Zevon's <em>Excitable Boy</em> album.  Whoever is responsible for keeping this track off the Internet is doing a bang-up job.  Even Rhapsody, whose site indicates they have the full track available for legal streaming, only has a 30 second sample.  Fortunately, <em>Excitable Boy</em> is an excellent record well worth paying for.</p>
<p>Jackson Browne plays guitar on the 2007 <strong>Rilo Kiley</strong> song "The Angels Hung Around". The video below has terrible sound quality, so if you like it, here's one more to go buy.</p>

<p>Rilo Kiley was one of many indie luminaries who performed on "Do They Know It's Hallowe'en", a parody of charity singles and, yet, an actual charity single itself.  (Proceeds went to UNICEF.)</p>

<p>Other people on that track include <strong>Beck</strong>, members of <strong>Arcade Fire</strong>, and <strong>Karen O</strong> of <strong>The Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong>, which brings us to The Flaming Lips and <em>Embryonic</em>.</p>
<p>Karen O performed on three tracks from the new Flaming Lips record.  Here she is with them on "Gemini Syringes".</p>
