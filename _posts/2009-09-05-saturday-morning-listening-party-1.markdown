  content: Rich, Nice post! I think this sort of storytelling works really well with
    your music routes concept. Congrats on the new home. Ray

<p>I moved recently.  My new home has two things that my old home did not: an old console record player and a fantastically ramshackle second-hand shop nearby that sells records for $1 each.</p>
<p>So, this morning started what I hope will become a tradition: Saturday Morning Listening Party which I suppose will inevitably be abbreviated to SMLP so let's just start with that now.</p>
<p>I purchased the <strong>Joe Cocker</strong> LP <em>Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen</em> and Humuhumu purchased the soundtrack to the Warner Bros. film version of <em>The Music Man</em>.  We listened to both records while unpacking and cleaning.  And I mapped out the music route between <em>Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen</em> and <em>The Music Man</em> film soundtrack.</p>
<p><em>The Music Man</em> features <strong>Shirley Jones</strong> and <strong>Robert Preston</strong>.  It also features a barely post-toddler <strong>Ron Howard</strong> (billed as Ronnie Howard).  But back to Shirley Jones:  She subsequently played the mother on <em>The Partridge Family</em> .  But before that and <em>The Music Man</em>, she was in the film version of <em>Carousel</em>. She even got to perform a song from <em>Carousel</em> on television with <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong>.</p>
<p>Sinatra in turn recorded a duet late in life with <strong>Luciano Pavarotti</strong>—seriously—on Sinatra's signature song, "My Way".  And Pavarotti in turn performed a duet at a benefit concert with Joe Cocker on Cocker's signature song, "You Are So Beautiful".</p>

<p>This brings us to <em>Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen</em>.  The purchase was both a bargain and a rip-off.  It was a bargain because it is a double album yet it was the same low price as all the other records.  It was a rip-off because the two LPs were from different editions.  One had side 1 and 2, while the other (in considerably poorer shape) had sides 1 and 4.  So, I don't have side 3 at all.</p>
<p><em>Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen</em> is a live record.  Here is "Space Captain" from that recording (or, at least, from the same tour) complete with 22 people performing on stage, including <strong>Leon Russel</strong> in a fantastic hat and an unknown <strong>Rita Coolidge</strong> among the background vocalists.</p>
<p>Our housewarming party is next Saturday.  If you're coming, consider bringing an LP for SMLP #2 (although it's an afternoon party, so it's already a misnomer&mdash;oh, well).</p>
