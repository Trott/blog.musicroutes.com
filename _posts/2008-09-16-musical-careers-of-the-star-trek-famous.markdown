<p>Connecting <strong>William Shatner</strong> to other musicians has proved easy.  He released a record a few years ago that had <strong>Ben Folds</strong>, <strong>Joe Jackson</strong>, <strong>Aimee Mann</strong>, <strong>Henry Rollins</strong>, and others on it.  However, I have been unable to connect Shatner to <strong>Leonard Nimoy</strong>!</p>
<p>Nimoy has released several albums.  But as far as I know, none of the musicians he recorded with have ever been identified.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Tétreault</strong>'s <em>Snipettes! </em>has Nimoy on it, but it's samples of Nimoy, so he's not really a performer on that recording.</p>
