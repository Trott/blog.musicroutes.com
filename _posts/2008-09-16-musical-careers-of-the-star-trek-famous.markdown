<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-93" title="Nimoy and Shatner" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/cd_spaced_out_01.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />Connecting <strong>William Shatner</strong> to other musicians has proved easy.  He released a record a few years ago that had <strong>Ben Folds</strong>, <strong>Joe Jackson</strong>, <strong>Aimee Mann</strong>, <strong>Henry Rollins</strong>, and others on it.  However, I have been unable to connect Shatner to <strong>Leonard Nimoy</strong>!</p>
<p>Nimoy has released several albums.  But as far as I know, none of the musicians he recorded with have ever been identified.  Hopefully, I'm wrong about that and you can <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">tell me</a> who has recorded with Leonard Nimoy.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Tétreault</strong>'s <em>Snipettes! </em>has Nimoy on it, but it's samples of Nimoy, so he's not really a performer on that recording.</p>
<p>In the meantime, because I cannot (yet) connect Shatner to Nimoy, here is <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=William+Shatner&amp;musicianName2=Bill+Cosby" target="_blank">William Shatner to <strong>Bill Cosby</strong></a>.</p>
