<p>I've integrated Janrain into Music Routes so you can log in to Music Routes with your Google or Facebook account.</p>
<p>This allows the site to reward people who contribute data with points and badges.  And if enough people actually use it, maybe there will be a leader-board too.</p>
<p>OK, so these things seem like gimmicks to you and they don't excite you.  Still, you're a music nerd and you want to preserve discography data that can be found nowhere else on the web.</p>
<p>That's why you're going to log in and add information to Music Routes!  Especially if you are in a band (and can thus provide authoritative information) or if you are a ridiculously knowledgable fan of a particular band, I need your help.</p>
<p>I could especially use assistance with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marillion</li>
<li>Frank Zappa</li>
<li>Pink Floyd</li>
<li>Johnny Cash</li>
<li>The Fall</li>
</ul>
