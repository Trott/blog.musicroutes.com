<p>The easily-offended might want to skip this post.</p>
<p>People using music routes frequently try to connect genteel artists to offensive artists.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they try to connect offensive artists to offensively bland artists (<a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=GG+Allin&amp;musicianName2=Kenny+G&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><strong>GG Allin</strong> to <strong>Kenny G</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes they try to connect offensive artists to unusual non-offensive artists (<a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=El+Duce&amp;musicianName2=Yma+Sumac&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><strong>El Duce</strong> to <strong>Yma Sumac</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes they try to connect offensive artists to famous actors who have released musical recordings (<a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Anal+Cunt&amp;musicianName2=Crispin+Glover&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><strong>Anal Cunt</strong> to <strong>Crispin Glover</strong></a>).</p>
<p>One offensive artist that comes up from time to time, but that I have had trouble linking to other artists, is <strong>Anal Blast</strong>.  This should be a slam dunk as one or two of their members went on to be in Slipknot.  However, I can't find recordings with those guys.  So I'm stuck.</p>
<p>If you have reasonably reliable Anal Blast discography data, please drop a comment here or <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">use the Contact Us form</a> to get in touch with me!</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that's the first time the phrase "reasonably reliable Anal Blast discography data" has ever been used.</p>
<p>While I'm at it, if you have any reliable personnel information for a <strong>Hemorrhoy Rogers</strong> recording, I'd like to have it.</p>
