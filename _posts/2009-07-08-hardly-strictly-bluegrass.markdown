<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-396" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/71974345_86b00fdf98_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="162" />Most of the roster for this year's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass event in San Francisco has been posted at <a href="http://strictlybluegrass.com/" target="_blank">strictlybluegrass.com</a>.  Those unfamiliar with the event (and perhaps even those familiar with it) may be surprised by some of the names that appear:  <strong>MC Hammer</strong>, <strong>Tom Morello</strong>, <strong>World Party</strong>...</p>
<p>Naturally, the correct measure of someone's bluegrass-ness would be their Music Routes distance from <strong>Earl Scruggs</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=MC+Hammer&amp;musicianName2=Earl+Scruggs" target="_blank">MC Hammer to Earl Scruggs</a> is currently at 4 steps.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=World+Party&amp;musicianName2=Earl+Scruggs" target="_blank">World Party to Earl Scruggs</a> is also currently at 4 steps.</p>
<p><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Tom+Morello&amp;musicianName2=Earl+Scruggs" target="_blank">Tom Morello to Earl Scruggs</a> is currently only 3 steps!</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Dolly+Parton&amp;musicianName2=Earl+Scruggs" target="_blank"><strong>Dolly Parton</strong> is 0 steps from Earl Scruggs</a>.</p>
