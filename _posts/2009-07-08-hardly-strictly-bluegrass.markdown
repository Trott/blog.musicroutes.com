<p>Most of the roster for this year's Hardly Strictly Bluegrass event in San Francisco has been posted at <a href="http://strictlybluegrass.com/" target="_blank">strictlybluegrass.com</a>.  Those unfamiliar with the event (and perhaps even those familiar with it) may be surprised by some of the names that appear:  <strong>MC Hammer</strong>, <strong>Tom Morello</strong>, <strong>World Party</strong>...</p>
<p>Naturally, the correct measure of someone's bluegrass-ness would be their Music Routes distance from <strong>Earl Scruggs</strong>.</p>
<p>MC Hammer to Earl Scruggs is currently at 4 steps.</p>
<p>World Party to Earl Scruggs is also currently at 4 steps.</p>
<p>Tom Morello to Earl Scruggs is currently only 3 steps!</p>
<p>For reference, <strong>Dolly Parton</strong> is 0 steps from Earl Scruggs.</p>
