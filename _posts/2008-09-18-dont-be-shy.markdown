<p>If you are, like me, a musician who has recorded with people who have recorded with other people who have recorded with other people who have had recorded brushes with music celebrity greatness, then this post is for you.</p>
<p>Go on!  Don't be shy!  <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php" target="_blank">Do a vanity route search on music routes!</a> Then, if you can't connect yourself to your musical hero/heroine, <a href="http://musicroutes.com/add.php" target="_blank">submit data about your recordings</a>.  This will help build all sorts of weird and funky routes.  And there's nothing better than weird and funky routes.</p>
<p>Heck, I started this site so I could do vanity searches.  Well, I guess I also wanted to find new music that I didn't know about but that I might be interested in because a musician I admired was on the recording.  But that's the second reason.  First and foremost, I wanted to be able to <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Rich+Trott&musicianName2=Elvis+Presley" target="_blank">connect myself to <strong>Elvis Presley</strong></a> and stuff like that.</p>
