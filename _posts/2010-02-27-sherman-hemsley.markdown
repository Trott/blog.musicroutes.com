<p>The prog music blogosphere (such as it is) recently went atwitter over a year-old article reporting that<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2009/03/05/george-jefferson-worlds-biggest-gong-fan/" target="_blank"><strong>Sherman Hemsley</strong>, star of <em>The Jeffersons</em>, is also a keyboardist who is a big fan of <strong>Daevid Allen</strong> and <strong>Gong</strong></a>.Â  The actor who portrayed George Jefferson apparently has had a special fondness for Gong's <em>Flying Teapot</em> album.</p>
<p>I was struck by the aside that Hemsley also wrote a rock opera with <strong>Jon Anderson</strong> of <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p>Alas, <a href="http://www.bondegezou.co.uk/wnja.htm" target="_blank">the "funk-rock opera" has never been produced or recorded</a>.</p>
<p>Which means that we cannot put Sherman Hemsley into the Music Routes database easily.</p>
<p>Here's Daevid Allen to Jon Anderson in four steps via <strong>Stewart Copeland</strong> and <strong>Tony Levin</strong>.</p>
<p>I suspect that route can be made shorter...</p>
