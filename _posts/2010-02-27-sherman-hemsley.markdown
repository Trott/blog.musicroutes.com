<p><a href="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/george_jefferson1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-627" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/george_jefferson1.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="249" /></a>The prog music blogosphere (such as it is) recently went atwitter over a year-old article reporting that<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2009/03/05/george-jefferson-worlds-biggest-gong-fan/" target="_blank"><strong>Sherman Hemsley</strong>, star of <em>The Jeffersons</em>, is also a keyboardist who is a big fan of <strong>Daevid Allen</strong> and <strong>Gong</strong></a>.Â  The actor who portrayed George Jefferson apparently has had a special fondness for Gong's <em>Flying Teapot</em> album.</p>
<p>I was struck by the aside that Hemsley also wrote a rock opera with <strong>Jon Anderson</strong> of <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p>Alas, <a href="http://www.bondegezou.co.uk/wnja.htm" target="_blank">the "funk-rock opera" has never been produced or recorded</a>.</p>
<p>Which means that we cannot put Sherman Hemsley into the Music Routes database easily.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=c8089850a69e2a588f591c04913be29f" target="_blank">Daevid Allen to Jon Anderson in four steps via <strong>Stewart Copeland</strong> and <strong>Tony Levin</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I suspect that route can be made shorter...</p>
