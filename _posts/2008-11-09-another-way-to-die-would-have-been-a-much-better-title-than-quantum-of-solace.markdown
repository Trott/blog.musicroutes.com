<p>"Another Way To Die", the theme song for the looming James Bond flick (<em>Quantum Of Solace</em>), is a collaboration between <strong>Jack White</strong> and <strong>Alicia Keys</strong>.  That's a pretty surprising combination right there, at least to me. Naturally, I had to put it in the Music Routes database immediately.</p>
<p>I chose to connect them to Duran Duran because their "A View To a Kill" is the only James Bond theme to ever hit #1 in the U.S.</p>
<p>(<em>Quantum Of Solace</em>?  Really?  They couldn't come up with a better title than that?)</p>
