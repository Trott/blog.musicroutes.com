<p>It has been reported that <a href="http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/pink-floyds-the.html" target="_blank"><strong>Pink Floyd</strong>'s <em>The Final Cut</em> pleases chickens and makes them shiver</a>.  I am skeptical that such a study is methodologically sound, but I sure hope it is.Â  I want this to be true.</p>
<p>So how far is <i>The Final Cut</i> from <strong>Rufus Thomas</strong>, the man that popularized "The Funky Chicken"?</p>
<p>Or any Pink Floyd?</p>
<p>If you feel that <em>The Final Cut</em> is a <strong>Roger Waters</strong> solo album that happens to be labeled as a Pink Floyd album and that <em>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</em> is not a legitimate Pink Floyd release, you can always try <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>.</p>
