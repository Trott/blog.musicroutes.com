<p>Today's LPs for the Saturday Morning Listening Party were selected from the nearby second-hand store by my sister Margo who is visiting from Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Album #1: <strong>Louis Prima</strong> &amp; <strong>Keely Smith</strong>, <em>Together</em>.  Margo especially liked "Mashuga".  Her husband always thinks of King Louie from <em>The Jungle Book</em> movie when he hears Louis Prima.  Margo feels like this 1960 album does not sound like it was recorded shortly before Prima and Smith divorced.  Smith sounds vaguely like <strong>Lena Horne</strong> to Margo.  She likes how Prima and Smith have contrasting and complementary voices.</p>
<p>Album #2: <strong>Uriah Heep</strong>, <em>Sweet Freedom</em>.  Margo thought that <strong>Mick Box</strong> looked like <strong>"Weird" Al Yankovic</strong> and <strong>Gary Thain</strong> looked like Kristy McNichol.  The album sounds to me a lot like <strong>Styx</strong>, especially vocalist <strong>David Byron</strong> who sounds indistinguishable from <strong>Dennis DeYoung</strong> to my ear.  The lyrics did not impress the SMLP attendees.  One song resorts to reciting the alphabet.  Margo said the album sounded like <strong>Jethro Tull</strong> meets <strong>Air Supply</strong> being mocked by <strong>Spinal Tap</strong>.   I'm pretty sure the Uriah Heep record drove Humu's mother from the building.  Humu looked online and found that Uriah Heep played in Armenia last month.  Uriah Heep dominated conversation for a while.  We had a lot of fun sending each other e-cards from www.uriah-heep.com.</p>
<p>The route from <em>Together</em> to <em>Sweet Freedom</em></a> is 6 steps.  Here we go!</p>
<p>The route starts with "Mutual Admiration Society" by Prima and Smith.  Unfortunately, I can't find it available from any free and legal service on the web.  (Help?)</p>
<p>Louis Prima and Keely Smith did a brief television performance with <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong> that was eventually released on the album <em>Classic Duets</em>.</p>
<p>On the same album, Sinatra sings with <strong>Bing Crosby</strong> and <strong>Dean Martin</strong> on "Together". Incidentally, this is a different tune than the title track from the Prima/Smith album that started this route.</p>
<p>Christmas is coming.  Bing Crosby and <strong>David Bowie</strong> had a duet on the Christmas song "The Little Drummer Boy".</p>
<p>One of Bowie's most beloved songs, "Changes", has <strong>Trevor Bolder</strong> on bass.</p>

<p>Bolder was the bass player in Uriah Heep for a while.  But he's not on <em>Sweet Freedom</em>.  He is on <em>Conquest</em>.  The route contains "Out On The Street" but again, I cannot find it on a free and legal web service.  (And again: Help?)  Here's "Carry On" from the same record.</p>

<p>This takes us to the end of the route, "Circus" from <em>Sweet Freedom</em>.</p>

<p>Best track in route:  I have to go with Bowie, "Changes".</p>
