<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-267" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/2203862517_0c66a5d6c8_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" />Not too long ago, <a href="http://blog.musicroutes.com/?p=185">I used a rant about people who have the wrong metadata associated with their mp3s as a jumping-off point</a>.  (Note to world: <strong>The Cure</strong> did not perform "Come On, Eileen", kthxbai.)  I looked at routes between <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong> (who wrote and first recorded "Blinded By The Light"), <strong>Manfred Mann</strong> (who had the biggest hit with the song), and <strong>Steve Miller</strong> (to whom that hit version is often erroneously attributed).</p>
<p>Since then, various combinations involving the phrase <em>blinded by the light</em> and the term <em>miller</em> have been the most common Google queries by which people find this blog.  In <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a cheap attempt to further drive people who are looking for the bass tablature to the song onto this site</span> the hope of supplying further edification for the curious, I wish to introduce <strong>The Blinded By The Light Project</strong>.</p>
<p>The completely pointless goals of this project are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To get "Blinded By The Light" by Bruce Springsteen two steps away from "Blinded By The Light" by Manfred Mann</li>
<li>To get Steve Miller two steps away from both versions</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's see how we're doing.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=ab6248d751c40c7e0a14ccc67c27b18b" target="_blank">The two "Blinded By The Light" tracks are four steps apart</a>.  It would seem to me that the most promising prospects for getting the route shortened are to look for possibilities with <strong>Chris Slade</strong> (who is on the Manfred Mann version) and <strong>David Sancious</strong> (who is on the Bruce Springsteen version).</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=60d2c71904305a5949f2238f342a80dd" target="_blank">Steve Miller to Bruce Springsteen's version is three steps</a>.  I suspect that it may be possible to get it down to two steps by using the fact that Springsteen sang on "We Are The World".</li>
<li><a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=6c3dd66c54244fc39314b2d94e1a9fdc" target="_blank">Steve Miller to Manfred Mann's version is five steps</a>.  This will probably be the most challenging route to shorten.  I'm guessing Chris Slade may be the key here too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
