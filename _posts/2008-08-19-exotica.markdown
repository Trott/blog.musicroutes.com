<p>I had the pleasure of attending <a href="http://www.tikioasis.com/" target="_blank">Tiki Oasis</a> this year in San Diego where <a href="http://www.ele-mental.org/~ecc/exo/exotica.html" target="_blank">Jeff Chenault</a> gave a talk about exotica music.  I took some notes and managed to plug in some data to get some interesting routes--I especially like <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=3be575b5635971e7aacf6b80986a25dd" target="_blank">this route from <strong>Les Baxter</strong> to <strong>Robert Drasnin</strong></a> via <strong>Duke Ellington</strong>'s most well-known recording of "Caravan" and <strong>Dizzy Gillespie</strong> (with <strong>Charlie Parker</strong>) on <strong>Red Norvo</strong>'s "Congo Blues"!</p>
<p>However, certain other important exotica figures--most notably <strong>Martin Denny</strong> and <strong>Arthur Lyman</strong>!--have proven a bit more difficult to hook into other people.  I was hoping there was a Martin Denny recording that had Les Baxter performing on it, but everything I've been able to find indicates Baxter as an arranger and composer.  Help, someone?</p>
<p>I'd also like to get information on <strong>Yma Sumac</strong>'s <em>Voice Of The Xtabay</em>.  Anyone have any ideas how I might find out who performed on that besides Sumac?</p>
