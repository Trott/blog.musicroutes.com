<p>MTV News <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1601504/20081217/lil_wayne.jhtml" target="_blank">named <strong>Lil Wayne</strong> their Man Of The Year</a>.</p>
<p>Not everyone is a fan.  One person <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1601618/20081218/story.jhtml" target="_blank">commented that "every time he sings, he sounds like he's taking a crap or something."</a></p>
<p>It is easy to quantify Lil Wayne's singing prowess.Â  Simply check his Music Routes distance from <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong>.</p>
