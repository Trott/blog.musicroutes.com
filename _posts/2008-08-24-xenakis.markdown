<p>Iannis Xenakis was a Greek composer of unusual and challenging music in the late 20th Century.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to provide routes involving Xenakis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am unaware of any recordings that have performance credits for Xenakis that also have performance credits for other specific individuals.</p>
<p>This is where you <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">send me a message</a> or <a href="http://blog.musicroutes.com/?p=37#respond">leave a comment</a> telling me that you know of a track where Xenakis is credited as a performer with others and provide that information to me.Â  Thanks in advance!</p>
