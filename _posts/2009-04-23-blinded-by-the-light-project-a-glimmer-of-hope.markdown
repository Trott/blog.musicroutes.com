<p><Yesterday, I wrote that I might have to relax the rules to achieve the third and final goal of the Blinded By The Light Project.</p>
<p>In the intervening time, new information has increased the chances of avoiding such an ignominious action.</p>
<p>While watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcWVL4B-4pI" target="_blank">this video of <strong>Manfred Mann's Earth Band</strong> performing "Blinded By The Light" on <em>The Midnight Special</em></a>, I noticed that there were female backing vocals near the end of the song.</p>
<p>There were no female backing vocalists visible on the set that I could see.  If the backing vocals were being performed live, they sure managed to be hard to see and silent (or inaudible) for quite a while.  But if they were pre-recorded, it was an odd choice for something to insert into a live performance unless they were also on the studio recording.</p>
<p>I listened to the studio recording again and, sure enough, the female backing vocals made an appearance in the same spot near the end of the song.</p>
<p>This means that there are more musicians on the track than just the ones I listed yesterday!  More musicians means more possibilities of shortening the route between it and the <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong> version.</p>
<p><em>The Roaring Silence</em> credits <strong>Doreen Chanter</strong>, <strong>Irene Chanter</strong>, and <strong>Suzanne Lynch</strong> with backing vocals on the album, but not on any specific song.  I went to Amoeba Records in San Francisco and purchased a used copy of T<em>he Best Of Manfred Mann's Earth Band</em>.  It credits those three with backing vocals on "Blinded By The Light" and that's good enough for me unless and until a more reliable source is found.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>Mick Rogers</strong> is credited with background vocals on the track too.  This is <a href="http://www.mick-rogers.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=50&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1" target="_blank">corroborated by Rogers's own site</a>.  (Unfortunately, his site does not list "Questions" as a song that he performed on—the <em>Best Of</em> credits list him for that song.  Either the site's information is incomplete or the CD credits are not quite correct.)</p>
<p>Brief tangent: The change I received when I purchased the Manfred Mann's Earth Band disc included Washington, D.C. quarters which feature <strong>Duke Ellington</strong>.</p>
<p>So, making what we can from the information available, it appears that the musicians on the Manfred Mann's Earth Band version are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manfred Mann</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chris Thompson</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chris Slade</strong></li>
<li><strong>Colin Pattenden</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dave Flett</strong></li>
<li>Doreen Chanter</li>
<li>Irene Chanter</li>
<li>Suzanne Lynch</li>
<li>Mick Rogers</li>
</ul>
<p>The musicians on the Bruce Springsteen version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruce Springsteen</li>
<li><strong>Clarence Clemons</strong></li>
<li><strong>David Sancious</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vinnie Lopez</strong></li>
<li><strong>Harold Wheeler</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge is to find a recorded song that has at least one musician from the first list and one musician from the second list.</p>
