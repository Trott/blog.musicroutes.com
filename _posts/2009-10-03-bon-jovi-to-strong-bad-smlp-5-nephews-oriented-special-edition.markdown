<p><img class="alignright" src="http://image.listen.com/img/170x170/7/2/6/2/1082627_170x170.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="170" />Today, I'm with Porterhouse and Xam, my 11-year old and 9-year-old nephews.  So I got their input on what to listen to this morning.</p>
<p>Porterhouse and Xam love <strong>Strong Bad</strong>, thanks in no small part to their awesome uncle. Earlier in the week, the Homestar Runner site released <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/crystal.html" target="_blank">a video for "Crystal Fortress" by <strong>They Might Be Giants</strong> featuring Strong Bad</a>. "Crystal Fortress" was selected as our route end point.  Porterhouse and Xam seemed to like it OK, but their mother laughed a lot harder at it.</p>
<p>When asked, Porterhouse informed me that his favorite band is <strong>Bon Jovi</strong>, greatly pleasing his New Jersey-born mother.  It was easy to decide what Bon Jovi song to use to start the route—the previous evening,  Porterhouse had rocked "Wanted Dead Or Alive" in the <em>Rock Band</em> video game.</p>

<p>In 1987, <strong>Cher</strong> released a reworking of "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)", a song with which she had a hit in the 1960s.  All of Bon Jovi appeared on the recording, including <strong>Jon Bon Jovi</strong> as a background vocalist and <strong>Richie Sambora</strong> who would be romantically involved with Cher around two years later.  <strong>Michael Bolton</strong> was also singing background vocals on the track.</p>

<p>"Far, Far Cry" from the star-studded <strong>Jonathan Elias</strong> record <em>Requiem For The Americas</em> is a two-part track.  Michael Bolton sings the lead vocals on the second part, "Let There Be Peace".  The lead vocals on the first part are by <strong>Jon Anderson</strong> of <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>

<p>Jon Anderson contributes background vocals on "Aimum" by <strong>Béla Fleck and the Flecktones</strong>.  (Like <strong>Béla Fleck</strong>, Xam and Porterhouse's mother is a banjo player.)  <strong>John Medeski</strong> of <strong>Medeski, Martin, and Wood</strong> plays the organ on that track.  Part of the track is used in the video below.  To hear the full song, click the play icon for the song in <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=6a214c95d8af519272135e7d1bb93f0a" target="_blank">the music route</a>.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="560" height="340" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2CXvD43IgQ4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2CXvD43IgQ4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>John Medeski also played organ on the <strong>Rufus Wainwright</strong> track "Release The Stars".  The trombone player on "Release The Stars" is <strong>Dan Levine</strong>.  To hear "Release The Stars", click the play icon for the song in <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=6a214c95d8af519272135e7d1bb93f0a" target="_blank">the music route</a>.</p>
<p>Dan Levine plays trombone on the They Might Be Giants track "Mr. Xcitement" which features <strong>Mike Doughty</strong> on vocals.  Alas, YouTube does not have this song, so to hear it, click the play icon for the song in <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=6a214c95d8af519272135e7d1bb93f0a" target="_blank">the music route</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, both members of They Might Be Giants play on the They Might Be Giants track, "Crystal Fortress" which <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/crystal.html" target="_blank">you should totally watch/listen to again</a>.</p>
