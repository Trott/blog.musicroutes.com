<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-105" title="Genius Loves Company" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/aray-300x297.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="297" />Is <strong>Terry Wood</strong>, who sings background on "Shame" by <strong>Randy Newman</strong> on the album <em>Bad Love</em>, the same guy as <strong>Terry Woods</strong>, who sings background on "Heaven Help Us" by <strong>Ray Charles</strong> on the album <em>Genius Loves Company</em>?</p>
<p>If so, which last name is actually his?</p>
<p>If it's the same person, it should make <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Terry+Wood&amp;musicianName2=Terry+Woods" target="_blank">this route</a> a little shorter—you know, 0 steps is less than 1 step and all that.</p>
<p>While we're talking about "Heaven Help Us", anyone have any idea of <strong>Chavonne Morris</strong> and <strong>Sheven Morris</strong>, both credited with background vocals on that track, are the same person?  If not, might Sheven Morris actually be named <strong>Steven Morris</strong>?</p>
<p>If you have the answers to any of these questions, post a comment here or <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">drop me a line</a>.</p>
