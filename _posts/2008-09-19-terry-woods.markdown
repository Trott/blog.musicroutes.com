<p>Is <strong>Terry Wood</strong>, who sings background on "Shame" by <strong>Randy Newman</strong> on the album <em>Bad Love</em>, the same guy as <strong>Terry Woods</strong>, who sings background on "Heaven Help Us" by <strong>Ray Charles</strong> on the album <em>Genius Loves Company</em>?</p>
<p>If so, which last name is actually his?</p>
<p>While we're talking about "Heaven Help Us", anyone have any idea of <strong>Chavonne Morris</strong> and <strong>Sheven Morris</strong>, both credited with background vocals on that track, are the same person?Â  If not, might Sheven Morris actually be named <strong>Steven Morris</strong>?</p>
