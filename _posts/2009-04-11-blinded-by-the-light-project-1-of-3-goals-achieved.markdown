<p>On March 15, the three goals for The Blinded By The Light Project were <a href="http://blog.musicroutes.com/?p=264" target="_blank">explained and announced</a>.</p>
<p>One goal was to find a way to get the route from <strong>Steve Miller</strong> to <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong>'s "Blinded By The Light" down from 3 steps to a mere 2 steps.</p>
<p>Today, we found out that studio musician <strong>Gary Mallaber</strong> played drums on Bruce Springsteen's "Dead Man Walkin'" from <em>Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture Dead Man Walking</em>.  Mallaber may be best-known for his involvement with <strong>The Steve Miller Band</strong>.</p>
<p>The result is that <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=e10909a2957988a0cd2943b6c12d0671" target="_blank">Steve Miller is now 2 steps from Bruce Springsteen's "Blinded By The Light"</a>, just the way the good Lord intended.  One of three goals has been achieved!</p>
<p>Progress has been made on a second goal too!  The addition of tracks that Steve Miller recorded with <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> now means that Miller has moved one step closer to the version of "Blinded By The Light" that was recorded by <strong>Manfred Mann's Earth Band</strong>.  <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=0b0661b61de974307f28b1ecf828d25a" target="_blank">From McCartney's <em>Flaming Pie</em> through <strong>Wings</strong> and <strong>Cheech &amp; Chong</strong>, it is now four steps from Miller to Manfred Mann's "Blinded By The Light".<br />
</a> The goal is to get it to two steps.  (Help us in the comments!)</p>
