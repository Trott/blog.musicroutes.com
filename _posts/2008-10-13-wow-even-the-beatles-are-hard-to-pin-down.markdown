<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-120" title="Revolver" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/arevolver-300x299.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="299" />Oh, for the love of apple scruffs, can't we have reasonably reliable and consistent performance information freely available for <strong>The Beatles</strong>?!</p>
<p>Let's look at "Good Day Sunshine".</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thebeatleshk.com/Discography/Albums/Revolver.html" target="_blank">http://www.thebeatleshk.com/Discography/Albums/Revolver.html</a> says George Harrison played lead guitar on "Good Day Sunshine".  There's no guitar at all on that recording as far as I can tell.  (Maybe it's referring to guitar that was recorded and then not used?)</p>
<p><a href="http://perso.wanadoo.es/sissu/revolv.htm" target="_blank">http://perso.wanadoo.es/sissu/revolv.htm</a> says Ringo sang lead on "Good Day Sunshine".  Um, no.</p>
<p>The information at <a href="http://www.upv.es/~ecabrera/revolver.html" target="_blank">http://www.upv.es/~ecabrera/revolver.html</a> seems plausible on the subject of who played what on "Good Day Sunshine"  but wow, is that an ugly site.  Don't judge a book by its cover, I suppose.  Minor quibble:  It doesn't have credits for the handclaps.</p>
<p>The three sites above, by the way, all disagree as to which Beatles are and are not singing on "Eleanor Rigby".</p>
<p>Guess I ought to go to the library or a bookstore (online or otherwise) and get a copy of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Beatles_Recording_Sessions" target="_blank">The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions</a> </em>book.</p>
