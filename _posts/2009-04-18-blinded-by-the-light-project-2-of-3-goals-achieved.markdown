<p>Right now, my world is totally ruled by the video above of <strong>Manfred Mann</strong> performing "Do Wah Diddy Diddy".  And that's not entirely irrelevant to this post.</p>
<p>You may recall the three goals of the <a href="http://blog.musicroutes.com/?p=264" target="_blank">Blinded By The Light Project</a>.  OK, actually, you probably got here through a Google search and have no idea what I'm talking about.  So let me sum it up very quickly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect <strong>Steve Miller</strong> to <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong>'s version of "Blinded By The Light" in two steps.  <a href="http://blog.musicroutes.com/?p=347" target="_blank">This is done</a>.</li>
<li>Connect Steve Miller to the version of "Blinded By The Light" recorded by <strong>Manfred Mann's Earth Band</strong> in two steps.</li>
<li>Connect the two above-mentioned versions of "Blinded By The Light" to each other in two steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>We're still working on #3 (and could really use your help if you have any ideas) but I'm happy to report that #2 has been achieved!  <strong>Chris Thompson</strong>, the singer on the Manfred Mann's Earth Band track, was subsequently in a band called <strong>Night</strong>.  The piano player in Night was <strong>Nicky Hopkins</strong>.  In addition to recording with the <strong>Beatle</strong>s and the <strong>Rolling Stones</strong>, Nicky Hopkins has recorded with Steve Miller.</p>
<p>So, Chris Thompson connects Manfred Mann's Earth Band's "Blinded By The Light" to a Night track (step 1) and Nicky Hopkins connects the Night track to Steve Miller (step 2).</p>

<p>The two "Blinded By The Light" tracks are both still four steps apart.  Time to get to work on that!</p>
