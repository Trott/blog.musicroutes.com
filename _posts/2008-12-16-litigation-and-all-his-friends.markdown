<p>After reading news reports that <strong>Joe Satriani</strong> is suing <strong>Coldplay</strong> over alleged similarities between his "If I Could Fly" and their "Viva La Vida", I checked to see how far Satriani and Coldplay are in terms of Music Routes.</p>
<p>I wanted to be able to compare that to the distance between other celebrated/notorious examples of alleged song theft.  I immediately thought of the <strong>Chiffons</strong>' "He's So Fine" and <strong>George Harrison</strong>'s "My Sweet Lord".  But I don't have performance data for either track.</p>
<p>For the Chiffons, I have the four vocalists, but none of the instrumental accompanists.</p>
<p>For George Harrison, the album lists lots of musicians, but does not specify which musicians played on which track.  For example, three drummers are listed.</p>
<p>I suspect the names of the accompanists on the Chiffons track are impossible to identify with certainty.  I'd love to be wrong about that, though. Help?</p>
<p>As for the George Harrison track, I suspect some fanatical Beatlephile somewhere has pieced the information together. Are you that Beatlephile?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to Simon Leng's book <em>While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Music Of George Harrison</em>, I now have some educated guesses about which musicians were on which tracks.</p>
