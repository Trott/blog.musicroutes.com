<p>Tonight (October 15, 2008) in San Francisco, at the Independent, there is a show to raise money for the purposes of getting Barack Obama elected.  It is rumored that <strong>John Doe</strong> is the secret headliner.  (I guess since he's playing a show in San Francisco next month, they can't publicize this fact.  Well, either that, or the buzzing rumor mill is seriously wrong about who the headliner will be.)</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to try to connect Doe to someone amusing, but the best I can come up with is John Doe to <strong>Alan Doughty</strong> or John Doe to <strong>Mike Doughty</strong>.  And, you know, those just aren't that good.</p>
<p>Got any suggestions?</p>
