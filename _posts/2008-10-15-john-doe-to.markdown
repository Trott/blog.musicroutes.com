<p><a href="http://baracknrollsf.com/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-129 alignright" style="border: 0pt none;" title="Barack 'n' Roll SF" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/a-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Tonight (October 15, 2008) in San Francisco, at the Independent, there is a show to raise money for the purposes of getting Barack Obama elected.  It is rumored that <strong>John Doe</strong> is the secret headliner.  (I guess since he's playing a show in San Francisco next month, they can't publicize this fact.  Well, either that, or the buzzing rumor mill is seriously wrong about who the headliner will be.)</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to try to connect Doe to someone amusing, but the best I can come up with is <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=John+Doe&amp;musicianName2=Alan+Doughty&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">John Doe to <strong>Alan Doughty</strong></a> or <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=John+Doe&amp;musicianName2=Mike+Doughty&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">John Doe to <strong>Mike Doughty</strong></a>.  And, you know, those just aren't that good.</p>
<p>Got any suggestions?  <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">Email me</a> or leave a comment here.</p>
