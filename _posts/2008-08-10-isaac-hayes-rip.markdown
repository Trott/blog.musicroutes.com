<p>Soul great Isaac Hayes <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-hayes11-2008aug11,0,7289497.story" target="_blank">passed away today</a>.  I went to <a href="http://IsaacHayes.com/" target="_blank">IsaacHayes.com</a> to see if there was any news about it, and found <a href="http://www.isaachayes.com/myframes.html" target="_blank">this page</a> which (as of this writing) prominently features a photo of Hayes, Bernie Mac (who passed away yesterday), and Samuel L. Jackson.  As my ladyfriend just said, "Oh, Samuel L. Jackson, I hope you are wearing your seatbelt this week."</p>
<p>Hayes was a Scientologist.  Here's <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Isaac+Hayes&amp;musicianName2=Beck" target="_blank">a route from Hayes to fellow-Scientologist Beck</a>.</p>
<p>I've been playing around with <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Chef&amp;musicianName2=Beck">routes from  his <em>South Park</em> character Chef as well</a>.</p>
<p>As I check out multiple routes, I fine myself pondering the proximity of Meat Loaf to Chef/Hayes to the Mar-Kays and MGs to Levon Helm.  I don't know if I can explain why that makes me say, "Wow," but it does.</p>
