<p>Soul great Isaac Hayes <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-hayes11-2008aug11,0,7289497.story" target="_blank">passed away today</a>.  I went to <a href="http://IsaacHayes.com/" target="_blank">IsaacHayes.com</a> to see if there was any news about it, and found <a href="http://www.isaachayes.com/myframes.html" target="_blank">this page</a> which (as of this writing) prominently features a photo of Hayes, Bernie Mac (who passed away yesterday), and Samuel L. Jackson.  As my ladyfriend just said, "Oh, Samuel L. Jackson, I hope you are wearing your seatbelt this week."</p>
