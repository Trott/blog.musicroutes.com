<p>When I started Music Routes, one of the uses I imagined was for people to find music that they might not normally know about but that they might have an interest in.  If you like <strong>Albert Ayler </strong>and <strong>Frank Zappa</strong>, you might like some of the tracks that form <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Albert+Ayler&musicianName2=Frank+Zappa" target="_blank">a route from Ayler to Zappa</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, very different artists end up being closer than you might expect.  Whether that undermines or strengthens the practicality of using the site to discover music, I'm not sure.  Nonetheless, allow me to point out that <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Paul+Anka&musicianName2=Megadeth" target="_blank"><strong>Paul Anka</strong> to <strong>Megadeth</strong> are merely one step apart</a>.</p>
<p>If you know of other surprisingly short routes that are already in Music Routes or ought to be, leave a comment or <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">send me an email</a>!</p>
