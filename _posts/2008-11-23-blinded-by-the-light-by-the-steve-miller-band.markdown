<p>This is something that apparently greatly upsets him.  Here's what he has to say about believing that "Blinded By The Light" is performed by <strong>The Steve Miller Band</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="intelliTxt">[T]his... is sort of like saying <em>The Godfather</em> is your favorite John Wayne film.  Horrifying.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds about right to me, but why trust fallible human judgment on the matter when we have science?  We can quantify the distance between actors via Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon, and compare it to the <a target="_blank" href="http://musicroutes.com/">distance between musicians via Music Routes</a>.</p>
<p>First, let's find out how far about John Wayne and <em>The Godfather</em> are by heading over to The Oracle Of Bacon.  That site puts<a href="http://oracleofbacon.org/cgi-bin/movielinks?game=0&amp;firstname=Wayne%2C+John+(I)&amp;secondname=Marlon+Brando&amp;using=1&amp;start_year=1850&amp;end_year=2050&amp;dir=0&amp;use_genres=1&amp;g0=on&amp;g4=on&amp;g8=on&amp;g16=on&amp;g20=on&amp;g1=on&amp;g5=on&amp;g9=on&amp;g13=on&amp;g17=on&amp;g21=on&amp;g25=on&amp;g2=on&amp;g6=on&amp;g10=on&amp;g14=on&amp;g22=on&amp;g26=on&amp;g3=on&amp;g11=on&amp;g15=on&amp;g23=on&amp;g27=on" target="_blank"> John Wayne and <em>The Godfather </em>star Marlon Brando at 1 step apart</a>.</p>
<p>As Rawden points out, there are two notable recordings of "Blinded By The Light".  There is the original version by <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong> and there is the hugely successful version by <strong>Manfred Mann's Earth Band</strong>.</p>
<p>Springsteen and Steve Miller are 2 steps apart at the current time.</p>
<p>Manfred Mann's Earth Band and Steve Miller are currently 5 steps apart.</p>
<p>So, Rawden is actually cutting the offending misclassification of music too much slack.  At a minimum, it's really more like saying <a href="http://oracleofbacon.org/cgi-bin/movielinks?game=0&amp;firstname=Lucinda+Dickey&amp;secondname=Buster+Keaton&amp;using=1&amp;start_year=1850&amp;end_year=2050&amp;dir=0&amp;use_genres=1&amp;g0=on&amp;g4=on&amp;g8=on&amp;g16=on&amp;g20=on&amp;g1=on&amp;g5=on&amp;g9=on&amp;g13=on&amp;g17=on&amp;g21=on&amp;g25=on&amp;g2=on&amp;g6=on&amp;g10=on&amp;g14=on&amp;g22=on&amp;g26=on&amp;g3=on&amp;g11=on&amp;g15=on&amp;g23=on&amp;g27=on" target="_blank"><em>Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo</em> is your favorite Buster Keaton movie</a>.</p>
<p>(By the way, The Oracle Of Bacon runs on IMDB data which makes it pretty darned complete.  Sadly, there's no similar data set for music that lists performers on a track-by-track basis.  So, all the entries in Music Routes are ones provided either by me or else by readers such as yourself.  If you know how to shorten either of those routes, or otherwise have track-by-track performance data that you want to contribute, <a href="http://musicroutes.com/add.php" target="_blank">please do</a>!)</p>
