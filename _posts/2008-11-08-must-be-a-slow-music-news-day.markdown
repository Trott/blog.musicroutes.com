<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-170" title="Sia Furler performing with Zero 7" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/209540170_df3e42e607_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="168" />Must have been a slow music news day.  <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003888666" target="_blank">Billboard reported that <strong>Christina Aguilera</strong>'s next record may have electro elements.</a> They particularly cited the involvement of <strong>Sia Furler</strong>.</p>
<p>How much of a stretch is this, really?  Well, one crude, inaccurate, but fun measurement is <a target="_blank" href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?musicianName=Christina+Aguilera&amp;musicianName2=Sia+Furler">the distance from Aguilera to Furler in a Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon sort of route</a>.</p>
<p>I especially like that the particular route starts with two versions of "Live With Me" by <strong>The Rolling Stones</strong>.  (Or at least it did as of this writing.)  </p>
<p>As always, if you know how to make the route shorter, <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">get in touch</a> or leave a comment here.</p>
<p>If your suggestion removes "Live With Me" from the route, I will only be slightly saddened, and mostly grateful.</p>
