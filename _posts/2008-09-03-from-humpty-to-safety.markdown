<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-46" title="The Humpty Dance by Digital Underground" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/humptydance.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="279" />Before I started music routes, I had no idea how much specific discographical information was not available.  I figured that if I really wanted to know who played on <strong>Yma Sumac</strong>'s <em>Voice of the Xtabay</em>, I could find that information.</p>
<p>Turns out, I was wrong.  A lot of that information just isn't out there.  In fact, a lot of that information will never be known.  And that, to me, is a terrible shame.  So one of the things I'm excited about doing is making a repository for this information.</p>
<p>Often, an album will credit multiple bass players but not tell you who played on which track.  And perhaps that information is simply not known.  But if it is known by someone--anyone--I want it.</p>
<p>Another thing that's often difficult to figure out is to what extent an individual played on a particular track, and to what extent they programmed beats, sequenced MIDI, and dropped in samples using a computer.  For the purposes of music routes, I consider a DJ scratching to be a performer.  But I consider someone using a sequencer or programming a beat on a drum machine to be production or engineering work and not performing.</p>
<p>(Of course production work is not lower on a hierarchy than performing.  It's different, sometimes less important than the performances, but often more important than the performances.  "Eleanor Rigby" is a good song, and the <strong>Lennon/McCartney</strong> team deserve credit as songwriters.  And their singing is very good on it.  But that track is great due to producer <strong>George Martin</strong>'s string arrangement.)</p>
<p>All of which is a self-indulgent introduction to my difficulties getting performance data for <strong>Digital Underground</strong>.  Surely there's a way to hook "The Humpty Dance" to the "The Safety Dance" but I'm not sure how to get from <strong>Shock G</strong> to <strong>Men Without Hats</strong>.</p>
<p>OK, so the Men Without Hats part is easy.  They had <strong>Ian Anderson</strong> on one track, and he played with <strong>Tony Iommi</strong> and a million other people in <strong>Jethro Tull</strong> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But what about Digital Underground?  Perhaps Shock G can be connected to <strong>Tupac Shakur</strong>.  But are there tracks with Tupac that involve Shock G in a performance role too?  And then where to go from Tupac?</p>
<p>Yes, my hip hop awareness is less than my crusty burnt guitar rock awareness.  But that's why I'm posting this.  Help me out.  <a href="http://musicroutes.com/contact.php" target="_blank">Send me an email </a>or leave a comment here.</p>
