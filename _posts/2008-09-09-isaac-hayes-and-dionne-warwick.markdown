<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-62" title="Ultimate Isaac Hayes" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ayes-300x263.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="263" /><em>Ultimate Isaac Hayes: Can You Dig It?</em> has a track that is a medley of "By The Time I Get To Phoenix"  and "I Say A Little Prayer" that <strong>Isaac Hayes</strong> sings with <strong>Dionne Warwick</strong>.</p>
<p>This could be a great hub for connections, if only someone out there knows who is meant by <strong>Hot Buttered Soul Unlimited</strong>, the<strong> Isaac Hayes Movement</strong>, the <strong>Warwick Singers</strong>, the <strong>Dionne Warwick Rhythm Section</strong>, and the <strong>Atlantic International Orchestra</strong>.</p>
<p>Any help pinning these down to specific names would be greatly appreciated.  Was Hot Buttered Soul Unlimited always the same group of singers?  I imagine the personnel changed over time.  I want to know who it was on this particular performance.  Same goes for the other entities named above.</p>
