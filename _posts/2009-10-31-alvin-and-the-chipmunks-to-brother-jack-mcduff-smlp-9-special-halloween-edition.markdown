<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-529" src="http://blog.musicroutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Photo_103109_003-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" />Last week, <a href="http://blog.musicroutes.com/?p=514" target="_blank">I mentioned that I made the rookie error of not checking that a record isn't hopelessly warped before buying it</a>.</p>
<p>For this week's listening party, I would like to mention an even more fundamental error.  I failed to make sure that the record in the sleeve was the one specified on the sleeve itself.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>The Chipmunks Sing The Beatles Hits</em> came to the listening party in a Halloween costume as <em>Screamin'</em> by <strong>Brother Jack McDuff</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://musicroutes.com/route.php?route=cd45cc9bcf206ac8a7060810ff047ccd" target="_blank">route from <strong>Alvin and the Chipmunks</strong> to Jack McDuff</a> starts with the Chipmunks singing "Can't Buy Me Love".</p>

<p>The Chipmunks recorded a record with <strong>Canned Heat</strong>.  I'm not kidding.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yBfw_IrVnuI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yBfw_IrVnuI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Canned Heat guitarist <strong>Henry Vestine</strong> had previously played on some early <strong>Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention</strong> demos.  These demos were eventually released on a CD called <em>Joe's Corsage.</em> Here is "Any Way The Wind Blows" which was later re-recorded for <em>Freak Out!</em> and <em>Cruising With Ruben And The Jets</em>.  If you click over to YouTube, ignore the credits listed there.  They are from the version on <em>Cruising With Ruben And The Jets</em>.</p>

<p>Now that we've arrived at Zappa, we can turn in a jazzier direction to try to end up at Brother Jack McDuff.  Zappa's <em>The Grand Wazoo</em> featured his idiosyncratic take on big band music.  The title track includes a trombone solo by <strong>Billy Byers</strong>.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="250" height="40" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="flashvars" value="hostname=cowbell.grooveshark.com&amp;widgetID=16386544&amp;style=metal&amp;p=0" /><param name="src" value="http://listen.grooveshark.com/songWidget.swf" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="250" height="40" src="http://listen.grooveshark.com/songWidget.swf" flashvars="hostname=cowbell.grooveshark.com&amp;widgetID=16386544&amp;style=metal&amp;p=0" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window"></embed></object></p>
<p>Byers played on the eponymous record by <strong>The Jim Chapin Sextet</strong>.  Chapin is a drummer best known (to me, at least) for having authored <em>Advanced Techniques For The Modern Drummer</em> (1948).  It's a bummer that I can't find a recording online of "Cherokee" from that record.  "Cherokee" is, of course, a jazz classic, and this version features Byers, Chapin, and alto saxophone icon <strong>Phil Woods</strong>.</p>
<p>Phil Woods was in the ensemble that recorded the soundtrack for the film <em>Alfie</em>.  The music was penned by tenor saxophone collosus <strong>Sonny Rollins</strong>.  Jazz guitar great <strong>Kenny Burrell</strong> was also on the session.</p>

<p>This brings us at last to Brother Jack McDuff, as Kenny Burrell is on McDuff's <em>Screamin'</em> album.  Alas, it's another track ("One O'Clock Jump") that I can't seem to find online.  Given that lack of availability, you can imagine my disappointment when I went to put this record on only to discover that I had been sold a Chipmunks record in a Brother Jack McDuff sleeve.</p>
<p>Best in set: "Alfie's Theme"</p>
